# HACC Docker Image

This image is used by the HACC Committee for checking submissions to code challenges.

## Usage

The `build.sh` script builds the Docker image.
The `run.sh` script starts a shell in the Docker container.

For each installed language there is an example available in the respective directory.
To execute the example, `cd` to the language of choice and run `run.sh`.

If you are to submit a program to the HACC, please paste your program in the example file, and check if it runs.
This ensures we can test your submission.
